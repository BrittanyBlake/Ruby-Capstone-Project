Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. It is a real-world-like project built with business specifications This project was at the end of the Ruby curriculum section. I was asked to create a web scraper with Ruby. I chose to scrape information from a popular store here in Spain, <a href="https://www.mediamarkt.es/es/category/_smartphones-701189.html?searchParams=&sort=&view=PRODUCTLIST&page=1">Mediamarkt</a> where I often shop. My project collects information about the description and specifications of the smartphones they have available.
